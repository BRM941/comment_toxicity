# Comment Toxicity Detector

### Description

This comment toxicity detector can detect if a comment pasted into its input is toxic or not. It also gives a confidence level on a scale of 0 to 1 where  0 means that the AI is confident that the comment is toxic and 1 means that the comment is confident that the comment is not toxic. A toxic comment in this case is defined as being hateful, violent, using excessive swearing, or other comments that may be against the terms of service for major social media sites.
